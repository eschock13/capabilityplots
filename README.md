# CapabilityPlots

CapabilityPlots is a python package that contains 6 different quality control plots
The main goal of this is to mimic a MiniTab capability sixpack
The result is almost identical but you can also call each plot individually

## Installation and updating

## Usage
Features:
* basicFunctions.addition  --> returns the sum of two inputs 
* basicFunctions.subtraction    --> returns the difference of two inputs
* basicFunctions.multiplication      --> returns the product of two inputs
* basicFunctions.division      --> returns the quotient of two inputs

#### Demo of some of the features:
```python
import CapabilityPlots as cp

a = 1
b = 2
add = ZDC.basicFunctions.addition(a, b)
sub = ZDC.basicFunctions.subtraction(a, b)
```
